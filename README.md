# FizzBuzz Test Answer

This is my answer to the FizzBuzz test in Python.

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

It's obviously not a perfect answer however it makes use of unit tests, complies with pylint and has had radon cc run against it.

## Usage

Very simple to use just run Python in interactive mode and type the following commands.

```bash
python
>>> from fizz_buzz.main import *
>>> fizz_buzz()
```
